## Branches

- branch **master** is THE new Spec-Debugger, into which all the new features will gradually be integrated.  
**Use this branch if you want to try out the Spec-Debugger** to debug things and experiment all the new features
- branch **originalSpecDebugger** is the original Spec-Debugger, and is here if we ever need to start something (experiment or other) from a state not cluttered by too many new features.
- **all the other branches** are meant to contain work specific features, and to be integrated into master when the features are ready.
